#Project Overview:

Welcome to the final summative project of the Advanced Front-End module. This group project challenges you to showcase your advanced front-end development skills by building a dynamic and user-friendly dashboard for a university residence management system. 

#Project Description

Develop a responsive and interactive dashboard for university residence staff using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and a chosen framework (Bootstrap or Tailwind). The dashboard should provide functionalities like:

    1.Data Visualization: Utilize charts and graphs (e.g., bar charts, pie charts) to represent residence data like occupancy rates, room types, and maintenance requests. Consider libraries like Chart.js or D3.js.

    2.Room Management: Display a list of rooms with details like resident information, room status (occupied, vacant, under maintenance), and basic amenities. Allow filtering and sorting options.

    3.Maintenance Requests: Provide a section to view and manage maintenance requests submitted by residents. Include functionalities like filtering by room, status (pending, ongoing, completed), and adding notes.

    4.Alerts and Notifications: Display important alerts and notifications for staff, such as upcoming room inspections, maintenance deadlines, or urgent resident requests.

    5.Theme Switcher: Implement a feature that allows staff to switch between different themes (light/dark or custom colors) using browser storage (cookies or local storage).

#Technical Considerations:

    1.HTML: Leverage Semantic HTML for improved accessibility and SEO.

    2.CSS:
        a.Utilize CSS Grid for a well-organized and responsive layout.
        b.Integrate a CSS framework like Bootstrap to streamline development and provide pre-built components.
        c.Employ SASS for efficient and maintainable CSS code with mixins, functions, variables, and partials.

    3.JavaScript/jQuery:
        a.Implement interactive elements using advanced JavaScript features like object-oriented programming and ES6 syntax.
        b.Utilize jQuery for DOM manipulation and Ajax requests to fetch data from a mock API simulating the residence management system's backend.
        c.Charting Libraries: Choose a suitable library like Chart.js or D3.js to create visualizations for residence data.


#Project Deliverables:

    1.Functional Dashboard: A fully responsive and interactive dashboard showcasing the outlined functionalities.
    2.Clean and Commented Code: Well-structured and documented codebase using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and chosen libraries.
    3.Mock API Integration (Optional): A basic mock API (local JSON file) to simulate data retrieval.
    4.Project Documentation: A brief document outlining the project setup, technical choices, usage instructions, and any external libraries used.
